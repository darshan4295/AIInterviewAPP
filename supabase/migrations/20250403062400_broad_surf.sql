  # Fix Authentication Issues

  1. Changes
    - Drop all existing profile policies
    - Create new permissive policies for development
    - Enable immediate access after signup

  2. Security
    - Note: These policies are intentionally permissive for development
    - Should be replaced with stricter policies for production
